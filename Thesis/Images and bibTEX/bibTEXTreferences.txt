abstract = {The branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithmic framework has been used successfully to find exact solutions for a wide array of optimization problems. B&B uses a tree search strategy to implicitly enumerate all possible solutions to a given problem, applying pruning rules to eliminate regions of the search space that cannot lead to a better solution. There are three algorithmic components in B&B that can be specified by the user to fine-tune the behavior of the algorithm. These components are the search strategy, the branching strategy, and the pruning rules. This survey presents a description of recent research advances in the design of B&B algorithms, particularly with regards to these three components. Moreover, three future research directions are provided in order to motivate further exploration in these areas.}

Computational considerations, including trade-offs between length of computation and storage requirements, are discussed and a comparison with dynamic programming is made. Various applications outside the domain of mathematical programming are also mentioned.},

It is shown that ideas latent in the work of two Hungarian mathematicians may be exploited to yield a new method of solving this problem.},

abstract = {Abstract Conventional methods for surveying diadromous fish migration from marine coastal waters to freshwater habitats are mainly based on electrofishing, a non-optimal technique for the study of fish migrations in rivers, and fishermen catch data. Underwater video has been recognized for a long time as a good alternative, but those approaches usually require intensive labour for retrieving the information from the video sequences. To overcome these problems, an underwater video system specifically designed for field work (low-weight, low-cost and autonomous) named BichiCAM has been developed for automatically counting, measuring and tracking fish observed in video sequences. The efficiency and precision of the BichiCAM system were tested by filming Sicyopterus lagocephalus juveniles passing through the camera field of vision in the Saint-Etienne River, Reunion Island, Western Indian Ocean. The BichiCAM system accurately measured fish length of the observed individuals when lens distortion of the camera was corrected, and the error percentages on the measurements presented a standard deviation of 5.1\% of the total length. The BichiCAM system provides a powerful tool that will not only facilitate research on migrating fishes and invertebrates' communities but also allow studies of the effectiveness of fishways associated to dams or the impacts of fishery activities.
